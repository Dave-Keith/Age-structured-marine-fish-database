# Age-structured-marine-fish-database

This database is a compilation of age-structured abundance, weight, and fishing mortality metrics for over 100 commercially exploited marine fish populations.  Data were sourced from publicly available stock assessments from Canada (DFO, Department of Fisheries and Oceans), the United States (NOAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and Europe (ICES, International Council for the Exploration of the Sea).
Subsets of these data were analysed in the following publications:

1. Charbonneau, J. A., Keith, D. M., and Hutchings, J. A. 2018. Trends in the size and age structure of marine fishes. ICES Journal of Marine Science. 76(4):938-945.
2. Charbonneau, J. A., Keith, D. M., MacNeil, M.A., and Hutchings, J. A. 2020. Effects of fishing mortality on the age structure of marine fishes. Submitted to Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. (accepted)

This repository contains the following sections 
-	A master file containing key information about the stocks in the database 
-	Raw data for 92 stocks containing Fmsy data
-	Raw data for 10 stocks from DFO, for which Fmsy data are unavailable
-	PDF source files for the stock assessments 

**A WORD OF CAUTION**
Only stocks that were used in the analyses were QaQcâ€™d. Authors are not responsible for the misrepresentation of the data. Users are encouraged to directly consult the accompanying stock assessment PDF files for detailed stock-specific data and source information.
